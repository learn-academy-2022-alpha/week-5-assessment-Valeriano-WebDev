4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
  I believe a relational database are  databases associated with SQL management systems. In other words, typically those that contain
  tables as their main structure for representing data. Other databases would fall into the non-relational category.

  Researched answer:
  Non-relational databases store data through document, columnar, key-value, and graph stores. Programs such as MongoDB and NoSql are
  some of the most notable examples of Non-relational databases.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:
  Primary Keys are special identifiers assigned to each value in a DB. As a unique identifier, they serve the purpose of  distinguishing  pieces of data from one another despite possibly having
  the same value.


  Researched answer:
  Primary keys are typically integers/Bigints which are automatically assigned at table creation . Stored in the 'id' column.
